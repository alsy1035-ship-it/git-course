This repo was made for documintary purposes i will be documenting what i learned every day from react to tailwindcss
if you have any advice on coding or git in general i would be thankfull for it
note: the repo contains the latest project i have learned if you want to see the old code go to tags each one has its project


ðŸ•³Day 1 : 
  i tried downloading tailwindcss but i met some npm init and npm run dev issues.
  i tried using chatgpt to help me but to no avail,eventually i rage quet after 6 hours.

ðŸ•³Day 2 : 
  i was finally able to use tailwindcss after i found out that the version of tailwind and next.js i had did not need
tailwindcss tailwindcss.cmd wich were  supposed to be located in the bin folder after that i found out that i need to
learn React before next.js so here we are.
