This repo was made for documintary purposes i will be documenting what i learned every day from react to tailwindcss
if you have any advice on coding or git in general i would be thankfull for it


ðŸ•³Day 1 : 
  i tried downloading tailwindcss but i met some npm init and npm run dev issues.
  i tried using chatgpt to help me but to no avail,eventually i rage quet after 6 hours.

ðŸ•³Day 2 : 
  i was finally able to use tailwindcss after i found out that the version of tailwind and next.js i had did not need
tailwindcss tailwindcss.cmd wich were  supposed to be located in the bin folder after that i found out that i need to
learn React before next.js so here we are.
.i installed react and made a simple card with it not alot but its a start

ðŸ•³Day 3: internet was off for the whole day so i couldnt open any videos.

ðŸ•³Day 4: i made another simple card but this time i used probes.
things i learned today: 
1-css is a bitch when it comes to spacing out your items 
2-i can just add the projects with its css as a component without needing to delete it now need for tags just link the component to the app component
3-i need to watch a video on spacing and sizing stuff in css 

ðŸ•³Day 5: nothing much today but i worked a little bit on my css and i managed to make a rotation animation with the back of the card turning white instade of mirroring the content inside it. all in all it was a great experement.

ðŸ•³Day 6: Learned how to use usestate() function and made a simple app with it that increases and decreases the age + sets the name you cant set the name your self its already preset.
